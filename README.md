# Adding this as to clarify a few things
This script is a proof of concept for what could have been a theme loader for the Stand Mod menu, making use of "http requests" in order to store most of the data through Github rather than the user's computer.
Since then, I have retired from the project to pursue development on a greater scale.

## You may
- Fork, clone, use the code however you want.
- Recreate RTL, create a similar project or create a totally different project using this.
- Use the images included for Lua Scripts or regular themes alike.

I will not provide support for this.
Credits are not required but are appreciated.
